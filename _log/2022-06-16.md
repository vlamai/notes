Don’t use Logrus.  Prefer zerolog, zap.

Don’t use encoding/json. Use Easyjson, it’s simple and efficient, it uses a code generator to create the code needed from structure to json to minimize allocation.

[4 Strange Truths About Why We Fail to Write Clean Code That Are Rarely Discussed](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/4-strange-truths-about-why-we-fail-to-write-clean-code-that-are-rarely-discussed-bf8db252f747)

Quick ship code == bad code 

Manager measure productivity by lines of code == bad 

Measure productivity of a team by number of features == bad 

If developer don't own a code he doesn't care of it's quality. 

Team members not on same page. One want to do on this way other on other way. 

 **Conclusion**

1.  Strict deadlines force us to take on technical debt.
2.  Non-tech managers are a pain in the ass.
3.  Programmers lack ownership.
4.  Argument with team members.

[The martial arts of writing Go Dockerfile | by Kevin Wan | FAUN Publication](https://faun.pub/the-martial-arts-of-writing-go-dockerfile-9dcffd010619) #go #docker

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine AS builderLABEL stage=gobuilder
ENV CGO_ENABLED 0  
ENV GOOS linuxRUN apk update --no-cache && apk add --no-cache tzdata
WORKDIR /build
ADD go.mod .  
ADD go.sum .  
RUN go mod download  
COPY . .  
RUN go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /app/hello . /hello.go  
FROM alpine
RUN apk update --no-cache && apk add --no-cache ca-certificates  
COPY --from=builder /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York  
ENV TZ America/New_YorkWORKDIR /app  
COPY --from=builder /app/hello /app/hello
CMD [". /hello"]
```

-   `cgo` is disabled by default
-   Removed the debug message `-ldflags="-s -w"` to reduce the image size
-   Installed `ca-certificates` so that using `TLS` certificates is not a problem
-   `tzdata` is installed in the `builder` image, and only the required timezone is copied in the final image
-   automatically set the local time zone so that we see `New York` time in the container

[Partitioning in Postgres — Part 2 | by Krish Na | Jun, 2022 | Medium](https://link.medium.com/BYYOk2c9Tqb)

We can create table partitions in 2 ways.  
1. _declarative partitioning — used to create partitioning while declaring/defining a table.  
2. inheritance — used to create partitions on already existing table. but on partitioning, already available data wont be partitioned to respective partition.
