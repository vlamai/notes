# [[Lecture 02 - Intermidiate SQL]] notes

Database Management Systems (**DBMS**) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

Data manipulation lang (DML)
Data definition lang (DDL)
Data control lang (DCL)

Also includes: 
- View definition
- Integrity and referential control 
- Transactions

SQL based on bags (**duplicates**) not on sets

**HAVING** filter results based on aggregate computation.

## Storage hierarchy
### volatile  
Faster, smaller, expensive. Random access, byte addressable.
- CPU registers 
- CPU cashes
- DRAM
### non-volatile
Slower, larger, cheaper. Sequential access, block addressable.
- SSD
- HDD
- Network storage

The slot array maps **slots** to the tuples starting position 
The **header** tracks of number of used slots and offset of the starting location of the last used slot.


### Log structured
